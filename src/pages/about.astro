  <h1>About Astro Widgets</h1>
  <p>
    Founded in 2025, Astro Widgets emerged from a simple idea: web development should be easier, 
    faster, and more enjoyable. Our team of passionate developers and designers came together to 
    create a comprehensive library of components that work seamlessly across all major frameworks.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    We envision a world where developers can focus on building amazing features rather than wrestling 
    with component compatibility issues. By leveraging the power of Astro and modern web standards, 
    we're making that vision a reality.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>
    Our components are meticulously crafted, thoroughly tested, and optimized for performance. 
    Each widget is designed to be framework-agnostic while maintaining the ability to work beautifully 
    within your chosen ecosystem.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>
    We're committed to open-source development, community collaboration, and continuous innovation. 
    Your feedback drives our roadmap, and your success is our success.
