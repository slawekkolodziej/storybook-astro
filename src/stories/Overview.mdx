# Astro Storybook

Welcome to the Astro Storybook experimental project! This repository demonstrates how Storybook can integrate with Astro components and multiple JavaScript frameworks.

## About This Project

This is an experimental project that enables Storybook support for Astro components. While not yet production-ready, it showcases the potential for building a comprehensive component library that works across multiple frameworks.

## Architecture

The project consists of two main packages:

- **@storybook/astro** - Defines the Storybook framework integration and handles server-side rendering of Astro components
- **@storybook/astro-renderer** - A client-side package that sends render requests to the Astro rendering proxy

## Supported Frameworks

This project demonstrates integration with multiple popular JavaScript frameworks:

- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight, declarative JavaScript framework
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **Vue** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **Svelte** - Compiler-based framework
- **Solid** - Fine-grained reactive framework
- **Preact** - Lightweight React alternative

## Component Examples

Browse the sidebar to explore component examples for each framework. Each example includes a Counter component demonstrating how the framework's reactivity system works within an Astro environment.

## Testing

This project uses Vitest to verify that the Astro Container API works as expected. Run tests with:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Development

To run the Storybook development server:

```bash
yarn storybook
```
